Create multiple connected tables in the DOMAIN domain via SQLite. One table must have a column "CLASS1", and the other must have a column "CLASS2", and they must be linked to the table with a column "COMMON_PROPERTY" (containing values such as "COMMON_VALUE", etc.). Other columns and tables are arbitrary.
